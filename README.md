# Approaches-for-Sensor-Data-Fusion
Data fusion is a framework that includes techniques
and resources for combining information from various
sources to create more precise, accurate, and perceptive data.
Strong data fusion methods are very important for reducing
measurement errors and improving observation accuracy.
Also, in dynamic and complex situations, it improves the
dependability of systems functioning. Data fusion makes it
possible to integrate information from multiple sources,which
makes real-time decision-making easier. This is important in
the rapidly evolving technological world of today
